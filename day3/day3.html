    <h2 class="u1">Charlie</h2>
    <div class="u3">
    <img src="1.jpg" alt="dog img">
    </div>
    <p class="u2">This is a nickname for Charles, and it means "free." In the human world we have Charlie Parker, Charlie Chaplin, and so on. This is a great name to give a happy, friendly, free-spirited dog such as, well, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.</p>


    <h2 class="u1">buddy</h2>
    <div class="u3">
    <img src="2.jpg" alt="dog img">
    </div>
    <p class="u2">Out of all the common dog names that mean “friend”, the most prominent one is “Buddy”. This probably has to do with the fact that the name is not only symbolic of friendship, it is also simple and easy for dogs to learn. One of the most dogs named “Buddy” was the Golden Retriever who was also a canine actor.</p>

    <h2 class="u1">bear</h2>
    <div class="u3">
    <img src="3.webp" alt="dog img">
    </div>
    <p class="u2">So if you call your dog 'Bear,' which is the most popular male dog name in the United States, according to the American Kennel Club, you probably love outdoor adventures, but you also have very loving side to you and are secretly longing for warmth and protection</p>

    <h2 class="u1">Bailey</h2>
    <div class="u3">
        <img src="4.jpg" alt="dog img">
    </div>
    <p class="u2">Bailey is a great unisex name. The word comes from "bailiff" and means "law enforcer," so it's a clever choice for a German Shepherd Dog or other police dog. The name's current popularity goes back to the 1970s and 80s to a female character on the television sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati.</p>
